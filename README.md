# Hewo there

Hey, you're finally awake. Cool! This here is designed for you to know who exactly I am.


## Who am I?

People usually call me Arty. I'm a hobbyist coder since 2009 and I've been working on stuff with AI for about two years now, although most of it isn't on this GitHub page ;-;

While I don't have that much of professional experience, I'm eager to learn and I'm willing to solve problems and cooperate with everyone to move a project. 


## Have you done anything notable?

Nope! I do things for fun and mostly don't make sense to anyone but me.


## Can I support you?

Of course! My official funding links are here:

- [PayPal](https://paypal.me/art3mi5)

Giving my projects stars also helps! It means a lot to me when people stop by and they think its excellent, so don't shy away giving stars if you think I'm doing well.
